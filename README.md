## Philosophy

In our age of information overload, [stream] embraces the ephemeral nature of thoughts. Most notes don't need to live forever. By automatically clearing away old thoughts, the app keeps you focused on what matters now while still allowing you to save the truly important ideas.

Let your thoughts flow like a stream - some will naturally drift away, others you'll choose to keep.
