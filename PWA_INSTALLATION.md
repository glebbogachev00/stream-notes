### ðŸŽ¨ UI Design Philosophy

The installation features are designed to be:
- **Clean**: Simple download arrow button without text clutter
- **Positioned**: Above the "talk to stream" button on the right side
- **Safari-focused**: Clear messaging that Safari is required
- **Non-intrusive**: Only shows when relevant (iOS users who haven't installed)
- **Themed**: Matches your current app theme perfectly
- **Respectful**: Won't spam you with repeated prompts
